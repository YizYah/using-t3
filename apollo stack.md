# apollo stack

While tRPC has huge advantages over graphql, there are use cases where graphql makes sense. 

To do that, after the steps shown through "Add a Real Database", you can do this:


1. install graphql: `npm install @apollo/server graphql`
2. go to https://github.com/apollo-server-integrations/apollo-server-integration-next and see the process.  But specifically https://github.com/apollo-server-integrations/apollo-server-integration-next#app-router-route-handlers.
